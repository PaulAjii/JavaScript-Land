JavaScript can display data in different ways:
  a. innerHTML - writing into the HTML element.
  b. document.write() - writing into the HTML document/output. - should only be used for testing purposes.
  c. window.alert() - writing into an alert box
  d. console.log() - writing into the browser console.

document.getElementById('id') is used to get access to the HTML element.
'id' attribute defines the HTML element.

Statements are instructions given to a computer to execute. JS statements include values, operators, expressions, keywords, comments...
JS statements often start with a keyword used to identify the kind of action to be performed.

JavaScript recognises two types of values: 
  a. Fixed Values e.g Numbers, Strings...These are called "Literals".
  b. Variable Values are also called "Variables". They are used to store data values. JS uses the "var", "let", and "const" keywords to declare a variable. The "=" sign (also "Assignment Operator") is used to assign a value to assign a value to a variable.

JavaScript Operators
JS uses "Arithmetic Operators" to compute values
"+" for "Addition",
"-" for "Subtraction",
"*" for "Multiplication", and
"/" for "Division".
